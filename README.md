# Credit card offer project (classification)

## Description
In this project, a model is obtained that classifies when a customer who has a credit card accepts or rejects a reward program offered by the bank, performing a logistic regression, and considering the imbalance data in this objective column (accepts or rejects).

Several techniques for the treatment of imbalance data are discussed, such as the oversampling, undersampling and the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique. 

The confusion matrixes and the metrics that evaluate the performance of the classification model are calculated, such as precision, accuracy, sensitivity or recall, F1 score and Cohen's Kappa Score.

All of the above is done with due exploratory data analysis, cleaning and treatment.

Likewise, some other interesting ideas on the database are reviewed, making graphs.

## Planning

- Into this [Github](https://github.com/users/RetCast/projects/1) you can find the workflow that was followed to reach the clasification model.

## Instructions

- Clone the repo to run the model into your local environment
```

 ```
- You could open the file with `jupyter-notebooks` or `google-collaboratory` to run it
