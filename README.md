# Credit card offer project (classification)

## Introduction
In this project, a model is made that serves to classify when a customer who has a credit card accepts or rejects a reward program offered by the bank.
Ideas for better understanding customers are also provided.

## Description
In this work, a model is obtained that classifies whether or not a client accepts the offered offer, performing a logistic regression, 
and considering the imbalance data in this objective column (accepts or rejects).

Several techniques for the treatment of imbalance data are discussed, such as the oversampling, undersampling and the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique. 

The confusion matrixes and the metrics that evaluate the performance of the classification model are calculated, such as precision, accuracy, sensitivity or recall, F1 score and Cohen's Kappa Score.

All of the above is done with due exploratory data analysis, cleaning and treatment.

Likewise, some other interesting ideas on the database are reviewed, making graphs.

## Planning
